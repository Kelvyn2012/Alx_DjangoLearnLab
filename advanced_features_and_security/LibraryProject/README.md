## Permissions & Groups Setup

### Custom Permissions
Defined in the `Article` model (`models.py`) as:
- can_view
- can_create
- can_edit
- can_delete

### User Groups
Created via `setup_groups.py`:
- **Viewers**: Only can_view
- **Editors**: can_view, can_create, can_edit
- **Admins**: All permissions

### Views
Protected using `@permission_required` decorators:
- `book_list`: requires can_view
- `book_create`: requires can_create
- `book_edit`: requires can_edit
- `book_delete`: requires can_delete

### Testing
Create test users and assign them to different groups.
Login as each and attempt actions to confirm enforcement.

> You can also manage users, permissions, and groups from the Django Admin dashboard.
